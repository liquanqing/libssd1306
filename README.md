libssd1306
==========

A pure C implementation to interface the 52Pi OLEDs based on SSD1306 using the Rapsberry PI 3.

This is a CMake project which allows out of source builds. Simply run:
 > mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../libssd1306/ && make

The compiled library and test application can be found under build/src then. Optionally you can set an install path and run
 > make install
